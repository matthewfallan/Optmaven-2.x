# This script rotates the relaxed antigen so as to minimize the z coordinates of its epitope, centers the epitope at the origin, and rotates the antigen so it points in the zero degree direction.
# The following arguments are required:
# -e: the name of this script
# -f: the file name of the antigen
# -args: 0: the file name of the output antigen
#        1: the antigen segment
#        2: the name of the experiment details file
#        3: the name of the output file of the antigen's and epitope's coordinate centers after rotation
